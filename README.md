# Mathematics for Machine Learning - My Solutions

This repository is intended to hold my solutions for the problem sets of the book [Mathematics for Machine Learning](https://mml-book.github.io/), which is freely available online.

You can find the solutions (in PDF format) for each chapter in the [/solutions](/solutions) directory, and the corresponding LaTeX source in the [/src](/src) directory.

For convenience, you can find the links for each resource here:
